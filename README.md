## Introduction
* `Datamatrix-ml Pharmaceuticals` is one of the leading Pharmaceutical Manufacturing companies with a global presence. 
* Their Markets are divided into different regions across the world. One of those regions manages the German and Poland Markets. 
* Company does not sell directly to customers. Instead, they work with a couple of Distributors in all their regions. 
* They have an agreement with each distributor to share their Sales Data. This is to enable them to gain insights up to the retail level. This data is made available to them in CSV format.

## Objectives
The firm has asked us to perform in-depth data analysis to get insight into company sales performance. Specifically, below are the essential requirements to be satisfied…
|Requirement ID|For Whom|Requirement Description|
|:--|:---|:--|
DM-DA01-REQ-1|Executive Committee|A high-level overview showing `company’s overall sales performance by `year` by `month,` by `customer cities,` by `channel,` by `sub-channel .`Should be able to quickly see `top drug class by sales`, `top drug by sales`, `top customer city by sales`
DM-DA01-REQ-2|Sales Manager/Sales Rep|A detailed overview showing sales `by distributors and product,` `top 5 product, customer and cities`, sales numbers split by `channels and sub-channels.`
DM-DA01-REQ-3|Head of Sales|A detailed report of `sales by sales-team split by product` and `sales by sales-team split by product class.` <br> A detailed analysis showing `Top sales managers`, `Top sales reps,` `Top product split by sales team contributions` answering. <br> An ability to filter/slice data by `year` and `months.`   

***Table-1 : Requirements***

## Solution Approach 

|Requirement ID|Solution ID|Proposed Solution|
|:--|:---|:--|
|DM-DA01-REQ-1|DM-DA01-SOL-1|An `Executive Summary` PowerBI dashboard/report page will be built to show a high-level overview of sales data in interactive visuals per the requirements. A `year` filter will be provided to filter the data by a particular or combination of years |
|DM-DA01-REQ-2|DM-DA01-SOL-2|A `Distributor & Customer Analysis` PowerBI dashboard/report page will be provided with interactive visuals showing data as per the requirement|
|DM-DA01-REQ-3|DM-DA01-SOL-3|A `Sales Team Performance` PowerBI dashboard/report page will be provided with interactive visuals showing data as per the requirement. `year` and `month` slicers will be provided to slice/filter data by year and/or months|

***Table-3 : Proposed Solution***

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [pandas]
To understand, be familiar with and check the sanity of the given data, the first step is EDA. This project's initial data exploration has been carried out using the `pandas` python package. Here, in general, we are checking... 
 * Presence of any missing values 
 * Any unusual value (outliers) 
 * Incorrect values (e.g., sales column, we see -ve numbers)
 * Determine `categorical` and `numeric` columns
 * Determine dimensions of categorical columns and range of numeric columns
Note that these steps can be performed using `PowerQuery Editor` and/or excel; however, `pandas` makes it much easier and faster; on top of that, `pandas` can handle massive datasets.

EDA steps can be found in the `data-exploration.ipynb` notebook.

### Data Cleaning and Transform [PowerQuery Editor]
The provided dataset was relatively clean and well organized; hence only a little work was required in this step; the following steps were carried out...
* Correct column heading provided
* Correct data type is assigned to columns

### Data Model Creation [PowerBI Desktop]
* The provided data is in a single table format. The exploration revealed that it contains both categorical (`dimensions`) and numeric (`facts`) data. 
* We build a data model where dimensions and facts are separated, then they are linked together by logical relationship to form a `star schema.` The resultant data model is shown below...

The tables with the prefix `DIM` are dimension tables, and `FACT` is the fact table.

### Report Creation [PowerBI Desktop]
Three interactive reports/dashboards (report pages) will be created to implement the proposed solution. Refer to [Table-3: Proposed Solution](#solution-approach) for detailed requirements and the corresponding proposed solution. 

#### 1. Executive Summary Report [DM-DA01-SOL-1]
This high-level report shows the overall sales figures and elements at a glance.

<img src="https://github.com/sssingh/pharmaceutical-sales-analysis-powerbi/blob/main/images/exec-summary-page.png?raw=true"/>

#### 2. Distributor & Customer Analysis Report [DM-DA01-SOL-2]
This more granular detailed report analyses data from the company distributors' and customers' perspectives. Sales by the distributor can be drilled down to specific product levels.

 #### 3. Sales  Team Performance Report [DM-DA01-SOL-3] 
 This is another detailed report that analyses the performance of the company's sales team. Sales by the sales team can be drilled down to product class and specific product levels.
