## Introduction
`Datamatrix-ml Pharmaceuticals` is one of the leading Pharmaceutical Manufacturing companies with a global presence. Their Markets are divided into different regions across the world. One of those regions manages the German and Poland Markets. But the company does not sell directly to customers. Instead, they work with a couple of Distributors in all their regions. They have an agreement with each distributor to share their Sales Data with them. This is to enable them to gain insights up to the retail level. 

## Objective
Our aim is to perform in-depth data analysis to get insight into company sales performance. Specifically, we seek to answer the below questions…
* The company as a whole…
  * How is the company’s overall sales performance is By year and by month
  * Which are the top sales country,  top sales city, top-selling product class, and product
  * How is the company’s overall sales performance by year and sales channel/sub-channel=
* How distributors are contributing to business and who are our top customers. 
* How each of the sales team is performing? Who is the top sales rep? and which product class and product are each team selling most?
